# Tomasz Pajor's dot files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

## Installation

  `git clone git://github.com/nijikon/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
  `cd ~/.dotfiles`
  `rake install`

  Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to get them.

  `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
  Run :BundleInstall in vim.
